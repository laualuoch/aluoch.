The implication of the synchronous nature of JavaScript is the delay in execution as long-running tasks are run to completion before proceeding ones are executed.", link:"https://medium.com/@aluoch/demystifying-asynchronous-programming-in-javascript-80e18145d117" },

Now, as a developer, it is important to build robust applications that are not only functional but also efficient.", link:"https://medium.com/@aluoch/mastering-python-errors-exceptions-and-exception-handling-a-comprehensive-guide-part-one-abc419f7008a"}
